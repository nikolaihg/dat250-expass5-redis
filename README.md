# dat250-expass-redis

Part of my "experimental assignments" in HVL DAT250 course

- Started with a main project for expass 1 - 3: https://github.com/nikolaihg/dat250-expass
- Frontend is part of the main repo and expass3 but also can be found here: https://github.com/nikolaihg/dat250-expass-frontend (before migration to main repo).
- Had to make a seperate for expass 4:https://github.com/nikolaihg/dat250-expass4-jpa that covered JPA.
- Expass5 that is NoSQL / redis is this repo.
  - But also here: https://github.com/nikolaihg/dat250-expass/blob/main/dat250-expass5.md
